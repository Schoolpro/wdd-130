    Hey Everyone!!! I am Alan, some friends used to call me "El Flaco" (Skinny in spanish). I am studying applied technology, 
    I love to play my guitars, yes I have a couple guitars, also a bass guitar, and a cello that I know just bassic sttuf. Recently I bought a 
    motorcycle, and I am in love with it.  I am divorced, I have a 10 years old son, I have a girlfriend. I am a self employee, I do logistics
    for trucking transportation companies. In the future I would like to work in something related to this carreer.

    What I love about BYUI, is that we all share the same principles, and that sometimes we get to talk about the gospel, and that is
    something you wont find in many other places.
    Carrers related to coding or specifically web design, have a lot of oportunities these dayss, because, a lot of tools we can use to work,
    or to have fun, are online, and someone have to built them, and fix them. In my business I do everything online, I dont even use my printer anymore.

    I have been a member since my whole life, I served a mission in Santiago de Chile, east mission, my mission president was Brad Willcox, 
    he was the coolest mission president ever.
    About a favorite scrypture, I like a lot, or pretty much everything, from D&C 88.
